This is the repository of Assembly Language Programming Project. 
Although Assembly language is not much commonly in use nowadays like other High Level programming languages but still it plays an important role in building hardware base implementation because it executes faster than high level.

Therefore, our aim and motivation are to design Crossword Game project in Assembly language.
It is a type of word puzzle that consists of letters of words placed in a grid in which you have to find hidden letters of words from the grid in all directions i.e. up, down, right, left and also in diagonal. Word searches are commonplace in newspapers and magazines.

To solve this crossword puzzle problem, we divided the whole problem into sub problems called levels and each level difficulty level increases step by step. The problem in this crossword puzzle game defines that the user has to find the hidden letters of words in the grid, if the user inputted the right letters of word, then the score is incremented and if the user didnâ€™t input the right letters of word, then the score is not incremented whereas the live of the user are decremented. The object of the game is to find the most words. The hidden words on the themed cards (i.e., school, home, cities, etc.) are in all directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, from left to right, and right to left.
